# RealTimeBusTracker

## What Does It Do?
This program identifies the locations of every bus in Boston using the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority website and uses markers to identify them on a Boston map. Every 15 seconds, the program updates the location of each bus by pulling the longitude and latitude from the MBTA data. 

Originally, the program only identified the location of one point on the map with a given longitude and latitude. I updated this program to pull data from the MBTA website to provide real-time locations of their city bus locations.

## Try It Out!
Load the `index.html` file in your browser. Every 15 seconds, the markers will update based on the current location of MBTA buses.

## What I Could Improve
This program would be even better if the map could predict the next stop for each bus along with tracking the data. The MBTA provides the schedules for the busses and this change would make the map more useful for a traveler in Boston.
